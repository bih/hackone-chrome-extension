### Contributing

Firstly, you can clone (or fork & clone) this repository: `git clone ssh://git@github.com/bih/hackone-chrome-extension.git`

Secondly, you can load this extension locally by going to your Extensions tab in Chrome, and you should see the "Load Unpacked Extension" button (If you don't, try clicking the "Developer Mode" button on the top right). After that, simply select this folder.

You should be able to make live changes to the folder and see them in the Chrome extension.

### TODO

- Create a walkthrough of how to use the extension
- Add tests
- Add linters
- Rewrite editor from scratch
- Test support across Chrome releases over the past 12 months
- Revise specification
- Create more sample apps

### Disclaimer

This was originally a hack I built in 2014, and I decided to re-release it upon the request of the community. I'm going to actively maintain this, because I believe this will be a fantastic open source tool for the global hackathon community.
